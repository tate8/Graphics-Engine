# Graphics-Engine

A small graphics engine created with [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/).\
It uses the MoltenVK library to run on Metal backend.
I created this engine following [this tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) but I have made and will continue to make my own modifications and abstractions.
